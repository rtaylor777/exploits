# 35513_python3.py
James Server python3 version of the exploit. Use at your own risk, fix if required, no warantee is expressed or implied :)

# 35513_cron_python3.py
James Server python3 version that exploits CRON by placing a file in /etc/cron.d <br />
Note: CRON has a few mitigations (behaviors?) that prevent this from working...<br />
1. Files in the /etc/cron.d directory can not have a "." in their name, not even an extension to a file works.</br>
2. The extra junk that is part of the email header seems to interfere with CRON processing the desired executable
portion of what is in the file that gets created in /etc/cron.d <br />

So why create this script? Metasploit has a version of this exploit that targets CRON so, I assume it must work on
older versions of CRON.<br />
